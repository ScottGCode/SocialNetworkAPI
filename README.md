# Social Network API 

## Description

Social media startups require an application that can handle large amounts of unstructured data using a NoSQL database. This is why I have created an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. This application also uses npm package date-fns for date formatting. Users are able to create, read, update and delete data in the application.
