# Social Network API 

## Description

Social media startups require an application that can handle large amounts of unstructured data using a NoSQL database. This is why I have created an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. This application also uses npm package date-fns for date formatting. Users are able to create, read, update and delete data in the application including adding and deleting thoughts and reactions. This helps create fast and effecient database queries and allows a social media startup to begin acquiring a large amount of users in a short amount of time.

## Installation

To start the social network API server;

1. Fork and clone repository from the GitHub link provided. 
2. In your code editor open the file in the integrated terminal. 
3. Run the command `npm install` to install required dependencies. 
4. Then type `npm start` to start the social network API server. 
5. The server will be running on `http://localhost:3001/`. 
6. Test the application using Insomnia or Postman. 

## Usage

To create, read, update, and delete data follow these steps; 

1. Use `http://localhost:3001/` and the `/api` endpoint to access the data in the application. 

2. Perform a GET to `/api/users` to see all users. Perform a GET to `/api/users/:id` to get a user by id. 

3. Perform a POST to `/api/users` to create a new user. Perform a PUT/DELETE to `/api/users/:id` to update or delete a user by id. 

4. Access `/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId` to POST to add a new friend to a user's friend list, or DELETE to remove a friend from a user's friend list. 

5. Using `/api/thoughts` you can GET all thoughts, GET to get a single thought by its _id, POST to create a new thought, PUT to update a thought by its _id and DELETE to remove a thought by its _id. 

6. Access `/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions` and POST to create a reaction stored in a single thought's reactions array field. DELETE to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's reactionId value.
